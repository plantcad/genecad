## CLI
- Use `argparse` for CLIs unless instructed otherwise
- By default, initialize logging in the `main` function with `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')`
- See @extract.py for an example CLI program
- CLI organization
  - Use `local/scripts` for ad-hoc, one-off debugging or analysis CLIs omitted from source control
  - Use `scripts/misc` for ad-hoc, analysis CLIs to be saved in source control
  - Use `scripts` for production CLIs that perform pipeline operations
- CLI execution
  - When prompted to provide CLI commands for execution, use the format `python ... 2>&1 | tee logs/exec/<operation_name>.log`
