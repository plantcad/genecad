## Table visualization
- Copy the provided table-like text as-is into a script in `local/table_viz.py`
- Do not modify the original text in any way
- Add any code necessary to convert the table to pandas and then style it with a `Styler`, as appropriate (be liberal with styles)
- Generate only one resulting file at `local/table_viz.html` and make sure all css is included within the file
